PCI 01.1.6,"PCI 01.1.6: Documentation and business justification for use of all services, protocols, and ports allowed, including documentation of security features implemented for those protocols considered to be insecure. Examples of insecure services, protocols","Compromises often happen due to unused or insecure service and ports, since these often have known vulnerabilities and many organizations don’t patch vulnerabilities for the services, protocols, and ports they don't use (even though the vulnerabilities are still present). By clearly defining and documenting the services, protocols, and ports that are necessary for business, organizations can ensure that all other services, protocols, and ports are disabled or removed. 

If insecure services, protocols, or ports are necessary for business, the risk posed by use of these protocols should be clearly understood and 
accepted by the organization, the use of the protocol should be justified, and the security features that allow these protocols to be used securely should be documented and implemented. If these insecure services, protocols, or ports are not necessary for business, 
they should be disabled or removed. ","1.1.6.a Verify that firewall and router configuration standards include a documented list of all services, protocols and ports, including business justification for each—for example, hypertext transfer protocol (HTTP) and Secure Sockets Layer

PCI 01.2.2,PCI 01.2.2: Secure and synchronize router configuration files.,"While the running (or active) router configuration files include the current, secure settings, the startup files (which are used when routers are re-
started or booted) must be updated with the same secure settings to ensure these settings are applied when the start-up configuration is run. 

Because they only run occasionally, start-up configuration files are often forgotten and are not updated. When a router re-starts and loads a 
start-up configuration that has not been updated with the same secure settings as those in the running configuration, it may result in weaker rules that allow malicious individuals into the network. 
","1.2.2.a Examine router configuration files to verify they are secured from unauthorized access.

PCI 01.2.3,"PCI 01.2.3: Install perimeter firewalls between all wireless networks and the cardholder data environment, and configure these firewalls to deny or, if traffic is necessary for business purposes, permit only authorized traffic between the wireless enviro","The known (or unknown) implementation and exploitation of wireless technology within a network is a common path for malicious 
individuals to gain access to the network and cardholder data. If a wireless device or network is 
installed without the entity’s knowledge, amalicious individual could easily and “invisibly” enter the network. If firewalls do not restrict 
access from wireless networks into the CDE, malicious individuals that gain unauthorized access to the wireless network can easily connect to the CDE and compromise account information.

PCI 01.3.3,PCI 01.3.3: Do not allow any direct connections inbound or outbound for traffic between the Internet and the cardholder data environment.,"Examination of all inbound and outbound connections allows for inspection and restriction of 
traffic based on the source and/or destination address, as well as inspection and blocking of 
unwanted content, thus preventing unfiltered access between untrusted and trusted environments. This helps prevent, for example, malicious individuals from sending data they've 
obtained from within your network out to an external untrusted server in an untrusted network.","1.3.3 Examine firewall and router configurations to verify direct 
connections inbound or outbound are not allowed for traffic

(For example, block traffic originating from the Internet with an internal source address.)","Normally a packet contains the IP address of the computer that originally sent it so other computers 
in the network know where the packet came from. Malicious individuals will often try to spoof (or imitate) the sending IP address so that the target 
system believes the packet is from a trusted source. 

Filtering packets coming into the network helps to, among other things, ensure packets are not “spoofed” to look like they are coming from an 
organization’s own internal network. ","1.3.4 Examine firewall and router configurations to verify that anti-spoofing measures are implemented, for example internal addresses cannot pass from the Internet into the DMZ."
PCI 01.3.5,PCI 01.3.5: Do not allow unauthorized outbound traffic from the cardholder data environment to the Internet.,"All traffic outbound from the cardholder data environment should be evaluated to ensure that it 
follows established, authorized rules. Connections should be inspected to restrict traffic to only authorized communications (for example by 
restricting source/destination addresses/ports, and/or blocking of content). ",1.3.5 Examine firewall and router configurations to verify that outbound traffic from the cardholder data environment to the Internet is explicitly authorized.
PCI 01.3.6,"PCI 01.3.6: Implement stateful inspection, also known as dynamic packet filtering. (That is, only “established” connections are allowed into the network.)","A firewall that performs stateful packet inspection maintains the ""state"" (or the status) for each

This applies to ALL default passwords, including but not limited to those used by operating systems, software","Malicious individuals (external and internal to an organization) often use vendor default settings, account names, and passwords to compromise operating system software, applications, and the systems on which they are installed. Because these default settings are often published and are well known in hacker communities, changing these settings will leave systems less vulnerable to attack.

The type of inspection will depend on the device—for example, photographs of devices that are known to be secure can be used to compare a device’s current appearance with its original appearance to see whether it has changed. Another option may be to use a secure marker pen, such as a UV light marker, to mark device surfaces and device openings so any tampering or replacement will be apparent. Criminals will often replace the outer casing of a device to hide their tampering, and these methods may help to detect such activities. Device vendors may also be able to provide security guidance and “how to” guides to help determine whether the device has been tampered with. 

The frequency of inspections will depend on factors such as location of device and whether the device is attended or unattended. For example, devices left in public areas without supervision by the organization’s personnel may have more frequent inspections than devices that are kept in secure areas or are supervised when they are accessible to the public.

This allows an entity to gain a better understanding of their potential exposure and develop a strategy to defend against attacks. 

A penetration test differs from a vulnerability scan, as a penetration test is an active process that may include exploiting identified vulnerabilities. Conducting a vulnerability scan may be one of the first steps a penetration tester will perform in order to plan the testing strategy, although it is not the only step. Even if a vulnerability scan does not detect known vulnerabilities, the penetration tester will often gain enough knowledge about the system to identify possible security gaps. 

Penetration testing is generally a highly manual process. While some automated tools may be used, the tester uses their knowledge of systems to penetrate into an environment. Often the tester will chain several types of exploits together with a goal of breaking through layers of defenses. For 
example, if the tester finds a means to gain access to an application server, they will then use the compromised server as a point to stage a new attack based on the resources the server has access to. In this way, a tester is able to simulate the methods performed by an attacker to identify areas of potential weakness in the environment. 

Penetration testing techniques will be different for different organizations, and the type, depth, and complexity of the testing will depend on the specific environment and the organization’s risk assessment. ","11.3 Examine penetration-testing methodology and interview responsible personnel to verify a methodology is implemented that includes the following:
